       <div> <h3 class="">The Pyramid at Chichén Itzá</h3>
        <img src="https://static.vikaspedia.in/media/images_en/education/childrens-corner/Pyramid.jpg" alt="">
        
        <p>Chichén Itzá, the most famous Mayan temple city, served as the political and economic centre of the Mayan civilization. Its various structures - the pyramid of Kukulkan, the Temple of Chac Mool, the Hall of the Thousand Pillars, and the Playing Field of the Prisoners – can still be seen today and are demonstrative of an extraordinary commitment to architectural space and composition. The pyramid itself was the last, and arguably the greatest, of all Mayan temples.

        <h3 class="">Christ the Redeemer (1931) Brazil</h3>
        <img src="https://static.vikaspedia.in/media/images_en/education/childrens-corner/ChristRedeemer.jpg" alt="">

        <p>This statue of Jesus stands some 38 meters tall, a top the Corcovado mountain overlooking Rio de Janeiro. Designed by Brazilian Heitor da Silva Costa and created by French sculptor Paul Landowski, it is one of the world’s best-known monuments. The statue took five years to construct and was inaugurated on October 12, 1931. It has become a symbol of the city and of the warmth of the Brazilian people, who receive visitors with open arms.

        <h3 class="">The Roman Colosseum-Italy
        </h3>

        <p>This great amphitheatre in the centre of Rome was built to give favours to successful legionnaires and to celebrate the glory of the Roman Empire. Its design concept still stands to this very day, and virtually every modern sports stadium some 2,000 years later still bears the irresistible imprint of the Colosseum's original design. Today, through films and history books, we are even more aware of the cruel fights and games that took place in this arena, all for the joy of the spectators.

        <h3 class="">Machu Picchu (1460-1470), Peru
        </h3>
        <img src="https://static.vikaspedia.in/media/images_en/education/childrens-corner/MachuPicchu.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Machu Picchu is an Incan citadel set high in the Andes Mountains in Peru, above the Urubamba River valley. Built in the 15th century and later abandoned, it’s renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone walls that fuse huge blocks without the use of mortar, intriguing buildings that play on astronomical alignments and panoramic views. Its exact former use remains a mystery.
